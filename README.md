Rudin's _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_, affectionately referred to as
_Baby Rudin_, is a staple textbook in analysis. Its presentation is clear and
direct, and has been enjoyed (endured?) by many students over the years.

Its typesetting is especially nice. While maintaining a LaTeX document of notes
on the book, I tried to emulate it with some slight modifications. The result
(in progress) is contained in this repository as a bare LaTeX class.

## Notes

I am using the "INDIAN EDITION" version of the Third Edition, published by
McGraw Hill Education. ISBN-10: 1-25-906478-6.

I have taken a few liberties with the style for now. (2017-05-09) For example,
I append a black box at the end of proofs to better signify their end. Rudin
simply puts more space at the end of a proof, but I'm not sure if I like that.
