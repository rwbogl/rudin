Rudin's _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_, affectionately referred to as
_Baby Rudin_, is a staple textbook in analysis. Its presentation is clear and
direct, and has been enjoyed (endured?) by many students over the years.

Its typesetting is especially nice. While maintaining a LaTeX document of notes
on the book, I tried to emulate it as best I could. The result is contained in
this repository as a bare LaTeX class.
